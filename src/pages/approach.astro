					Approach
				</h1>
		<p>
        At Lockstrom, we believe that software should serve the mission—not
        complicate it. Our approach is built on a foundation of clarity, trust,
        and adaptability, tailored to meet the unique demands of state and
        federal agencies.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-10 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Mission-Aligned Development</h2>
      <p>
        We start by listening. Every engagement begins with a deep understanding
        of your operational goals, constraints, and success metrics. Whether
        you're modernizing legacy infrastructure or launching a new digital
        service, we align our solutions with your mission from day one.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-10 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Modular, Scalable Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Lockstrom builds systems that grow with you. Our development philosophy
        emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and performance—ensuring that
        your software remains reliable and extensible across changing
        requirements and evolving technologies.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-10 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Security-First Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        We embed security into every layer of our process. From access control
        to data integrity, our solutions are designed to meet government-grade
        compliance standards while remaining user-friendly and efficient.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-10 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Transparent Communication</h2>
      <p>
        We operate with full transparency—clear documentation, predictable
        timelines, and open channels for feedback. Our clients are never left
        guessing. Every milestone is tracked, every decision documented, and
        every deliverable backed by accountability.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-10 tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Agile Delivery, Real Results</h2>

        fast, iterative results without sacrificing quality. We prototype early,
        test often, and refine continuously—so your stakeholders see progress,
        not promises.
